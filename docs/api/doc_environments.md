# `fitr.environments`

Functions to synthesize data from behavioural tasks.




## Graph

```python
fitr.environments.Graph()
```

Base object that defines a reinforcement learning task.

#### Definitions

- $\mathbf x \in \mathcal X$ be a one-hot state vector, where $|\mathcal X|=n_x$
- $\mathbf u \in \mathcal U$ be a one-hot action vector, where $|\mathcal U|=n_u$
- $\mathsf T = p(\mathbf x_{t+1}|\mathbf x_t, \mathbf u_t)$ be a transition tensor
- $p(\mathbf x)$ be a distribution over starting states
- $\mathcal J: \mathcal X \to \mathcal R$, where $\mathcal R \subseteq \mathbb R$ be a reward function

Arguments:

- **T**: Transition tensor
- **R**: Vector of rewards for each state such that scalar reward $r_t = \mathbf r^   op \mathbf x$
- **end_states**: A vector $\{0, 1\}^{n_x}$ identifying which states terminate a trial (aka episode)
- **p_start**: Initial state distribution
- **label**: A string identifying a name for the task
- **state_labels**: A list or array of strings labeling the different states (for plotting purposes)
- **action_labels**: A list or array of strings labeling the different actions (for plotting purposes)
- **rng**: `np.random.RandomState` object
- **f_reward**: A function whose first argument is a vector of rewards for each state, and whose second argument is a state vector, and whose output is a scalar reward
- **cmap**: Matplotlib colormap for plotting.

#### Notes

There are two critical methods for the `Graph` class: `observation()` and `step`. All instances of a `Graph` must be able to call these functions. Let's say you have some bandit task `MyBanditTask` that inherits from `Graph`. To run such a task would look something like this:

``` python
env = MyBanditTask()            # Instantiate your environment object
agent = MyAgent()               # Some agent object (arbitrary, really)
for t in range(ntrials):
    x = env.observation()       # Samples initial state
    u = agent.action(x)         # Choose some action
    x_, r, done = agent.step(u) # Transition based on action
```

What differentiates tasks are the transition tensor $\mathsf T$, starting state distribution $p(\mathbf x)$ and reward function $\mathcal J$ (which here would include the reward vector $\mathbf r$).

fitr.environments.step(self, action)
```

Executes a state transition in the environment.

Arguments:

action : A one-hot vector of type `ndarray((naction,))` indicating the action selected at the current state.

Returns:

A 3-tuple representing the next state (`ndarray((noutcomes,))`), scalar reward, and whether the current step terminates a trial (`bool`).

Raises:

`RuntimeError` if `env.observation()` not called after a previous `env.step(...)` call yielded a terminal state.
