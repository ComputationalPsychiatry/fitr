Tutorials
=========

We have several tutorials for Fitr written in Jupyter Notebooks:

1. `Introductory tutorial (EM and Bayesian Model Selection) <https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/fitr/blob/master/examples/intro-tutorial.ipynb>`_
2. `Fitting a Model with MCMC <https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/fitr/blob/master/examples/Fitting%20a%20Model%20with%20MCMC.ipynb>`_
3. `Use MCMC with your own Stan Code <https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/fitr/blob/master/examples/Use%20MCMC%20with%20your%20own%20Stan%20Code.ipynb>`_
4. `Using Multiple Model-Fitting Routines for Same Model <https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/fitr/blob/master/examples/Using%20Multiple%20Methods%20to%20fit%20Models.ipynb>`_
